Hotel-Booking-cancellation-project
Excel project

Objective :
THe objective of this project is to analyze customer behaviour in making hotel reservation and identify factors that impact the cancellation rate of reservation . Tha data for this project was obtained from the Hotel BOoking demand Dataset on Kaggle.

Exploratory Data analysis(EDA) with Data Visualization
To better understand the dataset ,we have come up with the list of question:

How many booking were cancelled by Hotel type?
Which month is most occupied with booking at the hotel? 1.How market segment effect Hotel booking? 1.How does ADR vary over the year by Hotel type?
What is the effect of deposit type on Cancellation?
what are the top ten country of origin of hotel visitor (guests)?
Observation
For the resort hotel ,a total of 27.76% Booking were cancelled and for city hotel ,a total of 41.73% booking were cancelled.

August month is most occupied with booking at the hotel.
Around 44% of booking are made via online travel agent,almost 19% of booking are made by offline travel agent and less than 1% booking are made by complementary .
The highest Average Daily Rate (ADR) has occurred in August and due to the highest ADR in August ,maybe it could be one of the reason for more of cancellation in August
Around 25% of booking were canceled by guests with No Deposit,followed by 15.49% booking were cancelled with Refundable.so it obvious that guests who do not pay any deposit while booking are likely to cancel more reservation
From our EDA,we have observed the following features in the dataset which helps in predicting cancellation from the guests are:

ADR
Deposit Type
Arrival month
The platform used to order
Strategies to counter High Cancellation at the Hotel
As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort than the city hotels. so,the hotel should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holiday.
In the month of January ,Hotels can start campaign or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.
They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
Monitor where the cancellation are comming from such as Market segment,Distribution Channels etc
Set Non-Refundable rate, collect Deposit,and implement more rigid cancellation project.
